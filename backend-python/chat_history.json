        "bot": "As a large language model, I can provide information and answer questions on a wide range of topics. I've been trained on a vast dataset, which allows me to generate human-like responses to various queries. Here are some areas I can assist with:\n\n- **General Knowledge**: I can provide facts, explanations, and summaries on numerous subjects, including history, science, technology, arts, culture, and more.\n\n- **Language and Linguistics**: I can help with grammar, syntax, vocabulary, translation, and language-related queries in multiple languages.\n\n- **Creative Writing**: I can generate stories, poems, scripts, and other creative content based on your prompts.\n\n- **Problem-Solving**: I can assist with logical puzzles, brainteasers, and provide step-by-step guidance for various tasks.\n\n- **Personalized Advice**: I can offer general advice on topics like relationships, career, health, and lifestyle, but please note that my responses are not a substitute for professional expertise.\n\n- **Data Analysis**: I can help interpret and summarize data, identify patterns, and provide insights.\n\n- **Code Assistance**: I can explain code snippets, provide syntax guidance, and help debug simple issues in various programming languages.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to my capabilities:\n\n- I cannot provide real-time information or access the internet for the latest updates.\n- My knowledge cutoff is June 2024, so I might not have information on events or developments after that date.\n- I cannot offer specialized professional advice (e.g., medical, legal, or financial) – always consult experts in those fields.\n- My responses are generated based on patterns in the data I was trained on, so I might occasionally provide inaccurate or incomplete information.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and informative response! If I'm unsure or unable to answer, I'll let you know.",
