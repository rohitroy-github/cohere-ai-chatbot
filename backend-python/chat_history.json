        "bot": "A **.py file** is a text file that contains Python code. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language, and `.py` is the standard file extension used to denote Python scripts or modules. Here’s what you need to know about `.py` files:\n\n - **Purpose**: `.py` files are used to store Python code, which can include functions, classes, variables, and executable scripts.\n - **Execution**: To run a `.py` file, you need a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can execute the file by running the command `python filename.py` in the terminal or command prompt.\n - **Structure**: The contents of a `.py` file are written in the Python programming language. This can range from simple scripts to complex programs or modules that can be imported into other Python scripts.\n - **Portability**: Python code in `.py` files is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any system with a compatible Python interpreter, regardless of the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).\n - **Examples**:\n   - A simple script: `print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n   - A module with functions:\n     ```python\n     def greet(name):\n         return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n     ```\n\nIn summary, a `.py` file is a container for Python code, allowing you to write, save, and execute programs or modules in the Python language.",

        "bot": "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for developing the **theory of relativity**, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. Here are some key aspects of his life and work:\n\n### **Major Contributions:**\n1. **Theory of Relativity:**\n   - **Special Relativity (1905):** Introduced concepts like the equivalence of mass and energy (famously expressed as \\( E = mc^2 \\)), time dilation, and length contraction.\n   - **General Relativity (1915):** Explained gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\n2. **Photoelectric Effect (1905):** Explained how light behaves as both a wave and a particle, a foundational idea in quantum mechanics. This work earned him the **1921 Nobel Prize in Physics**.\n\n3. **Cosmological Constant:** Proposed as part of his general relativity theory, though he later called it his \"biggest blunder.\" It has since been revived in modern cosmology to explain dark energy.\n\n4. **Bose-Einstein Statistics:** Worked with Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose to describe the behavior of bosons, leading to the concept of Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\n### **Early Life and Education:**\n- Born in Ulm, Germany, to Hermann and Pauline Einstein.\n- Struggled in school initially but showed a passion for mathematics and physics.\n- Graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich (1900) and worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, where he developed many of his groundbreaking ideas.\n\n### **Later Life and Legacy:**\n- Emigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape Nazi Germany and joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n- Advocated for civil rights, pacifism, and nuclear disarmament, famously writing to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 about the potential development of atomic weapons.\n- Died in Princeton in 1955, leaving behind a legacy as a scientific genius and a symbol of intellectual curiosity.\n\nEinstein's work not only transformed physics but also had profound implications for philosophy, technology, and our understanding of the cosmos. His iconic equation \\( E = mc^2 \\) remains one of the most famous formulas in science.",
