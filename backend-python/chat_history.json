        "bot": "A **.py file** is a text file that contains Python code. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language, and `.py` is the standard file extension used to denote Python scripts or modules. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about `.py` files:\n\n - **Purpose**: `.py` files are used to store Python code, which can include functions, classes, variables, and executable scripts.\n - **Execution**: To run a `.py` file, you need a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can execute the file by running the command `python filename.py` in the terminal or command prompt.\n - **Structure**: The contents of a `.py` file are written in the Python programming language. This can range from simple scripts to complex programs or modules that can be imported into other Python scripts.\n - **Portability**: Python code in `.py` files is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any system with a compatible Python interpreter, regardless of the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).\n - **Examples**:\n   - A simple script: `print(\"Hello, World!\")`\n   - A module with functions:\n     ```python\n     def greet(name):\n         return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n     ```\n\nIn summary, a `.py` file is a container for Python code, allowing you to write, save, and execute programs or modules in the Python language.",
